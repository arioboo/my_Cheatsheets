# my_Cheatsheets
My personal Cheatsheets for programming, editing, tasks, etc.

## Branches:

- main: An overall set of information in pdf, books, articles, cheatsheets, etc. in a lot of things. Keep in mind that this is a forked repository from other person, so that I will not change a lot the names of files.
- simplified: A curated and simplified list of trully cheatsheets. Also, there have been kept articles and miniguides that are so useful in certain occasions that I couldn't just remove them in this category. Suffixes/prefixes are so important here. Chosen cheatsheet have been renamed as "<topic>_cheatsheet.pdf".

### NOTES:
There are personal suffixes/prefixes in the notation of the cheatsheets.
